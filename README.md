## Sections

### 1. Variety of Foods

The "Variety of Foods" section showcases a diverse selection of delicious dishes, each with its description and image. Users can scroll through this section to explore the available food options.

### 2. Popular Meal

The "Popular Meal" section highlights the most popular dish of the day. It dynamically updates based on user preferences and ratings. JavaScript's `addEventListener` is used to handle user clicks and update the section accordingly.

### 3. Gallery

The "Gallery" section displays a collection of mouthwatering food images in a responsive grid. Users can click on an image to view it in a larger format using a lightbox effect, which is powered by JavaScript's `click` event and DOM manipulation.

## Navbar

The navigation bar (navbar) provides a user-friendly way for visitors to navigate through the website. It remains fixed at the top of the page as users scroll, ensuring easy access to different sections.

## Footer

The footer section contains essential information, such as contact details, social media links, and copyright information. It remains at the bottom of the page, providing a cohesive and professional design.

## JavaScript Interactivity

In this project, JavaScript plays a crucial role in adding interactivity to the Food website. Key JavaScript concepts and features used include:

- **Event Listeners**: `addEventListener` is employed to listen for user interactions, such as clicks on the "Popular Meal" section or images in the gallery.

- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript dynamically updates the "Popular Meal" section based on user preferences or data received from the server.

- **Click Event**: The "Gallery" section utilizes JavaScript's `click` event to trigger the lightbox effect and display larger images.

- **SetInterval**: A custom interval is set using `setInterval` to automatically cycle through the images in the gallery, providing a smooth and interactive experience for users.

## Responsive Design

The entire website is built to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. CSS media queries are utilized to optimize the layout and ensure a seamless experience across different devices.
